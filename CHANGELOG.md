# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- **ARQ worker crash** — `run_db_index` and `run_code_db_sync` worker tasks referenced non-existent service methods (`set_indexing_status_standalone`, `index_connection`, `run_sync_standalone`). Rewrote both to use `DbIndexPipeline` and `CodeDbSyncPipeline` with proper session management. Fixes #128
- **ReadinessBanner stale state** — Banner showing "index outdated" from a previous project was never cleared on project switch. Now resets `staleInfo` to null when the new project is not stale. Fixes #129
- **WrongDataModal empty connection_id** — Investigation form sent `connection_id: ""` when no DB connection was selected, causing 422 errors. Now validates connection and shows user-friendly toast. Fixes #130
- **useGlobalEvents null workflow_id crash** — `toLogEntry` called `.slice()` on potentially null `workflow_id`, crashing SSE event processing. Added null-safe fallback. Fixes #131
- **Traceback logging in task callbacks** — 5 files passed exception instances to `exc_info=` in asyncio task done callbacks where `sys.exc_info()` is empty. Changed to explicit `(type, value, traceback)` tuples for reliable stack traces. Fixes #132
- **chat.py missing ConnectionConfig import** — Added `TYPE_CHECKING` import for `ConnectionConfig`, resolving ruff F821 and mypy name-defined errors. Fixes #133
- **Ruff lint violations** — Resolved all E501 (line too long) and I001 (import sorting) across `chat.py`, `task_queue.py`, `main.py`, `email_service.py`. `ruff check app/` now passes clean. Fixes #134

### Added
- **Design system documentation** (`DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`) — Comprehensive visual guide covering semantic color tokens, typography scale, spacing, border-radius, shadows, icons, button variants, form inputs, cards, modals, tooltips, toasts, status indicators, animations, responsive rules, and accessibility guidelines
- **Frontend design system skill** (`.cursor/skills/frontend-design-system/SKILL.md`) — Cursor agent skill that enforces design system compliance on all future frontend work
- **Celery worker infrastructure** (`backend/app/worker.py`, `backend/app/core/task_queue.py`, `backend/app/core/cache.py`) — Redis-backed task queue with shared cache layer for background job processing

### Changed
- **Full design system migration** (68 frontend files) — Migrated all raw Tailwind palette classes (`zinc-*`, `blue-*`, `red-*`, `emerald-*`, `amber-*`, `purple-*`, etc.) to semantic design tokens (`surface-*`, `text-*`, `border-*`, `accent`, `success`, `error`, `warning`, `info`). Zero raw palette classes remain in component files
- **Typography scale enforcement** — Eliminated all off-scale font sizes: `text-[8px]`/`text-[9px]` → `text-[10px]`, `text-[11.5px]` → `text-[11px]`, `text-[12px]`/`text-[13px]` → `text-sm`, legal page h1 `text-3xl` → `text-2xl`
- **Card/panel border-radius standardization** — All card and panel containers now use `rounded-xl`; form inputs use `rounded-lg`; modals use `rounded-lg`
- **Modal accessibility** — OnboardingWizard now has `role="dialog"`, `aria-modal="true"`, `aria-labelledby`, focus trap, and Escape-to-close. WrongDataModal updated with `aria-labelledby` and correct shadow level
- **Toast styling** — Success/error/info toast variants now use semantic tokens instead of raw palette colors
- **Button focus rings** — ConfirmModal Cancel/Confirm buttons now have `focus-visible:ring` styles
- **Shadow standardization** — Eliminated `shadow-2xl` (modals → `shadow-xl`), `shadow-md` (LogPanel toggle → `shadow-lg`)
- **Batch service refactored** for Celery task queue support with improved error handling

### Fixed
- **Missing ARIA labels** — Added `aria-label` to icon-only buttons in InviteManager, LearningsPanel, ScheduleManager, NoteCard, DashboardBuilder, AccountMenu, LlmModelSelector, and OnboardingWizard
- **Missing `transition-colors`** — Added smooth color transitions to interactive elements in StageProgress, Sidebar, NotificationBell
- **ActionCard `aria-expanded`** — Expand/collapse button now correctly announces its state to screen readers
- **ConfirmModal typing input** — Added `aria-label` for the confirmation phrase input
- **SessionContinuationBanner invalid tokens** — Fixed references to non-existent tokens (`text-text-2`, `bg-border`) → valid semantic tokens
- **Test assertions updated** — VerificationBadge and ConfirmModal tests updated to match semantic token class names

### Added
- **Transactional emails via Resend** (`backend/app/services/email_service.py`) — Three email types: welcome email on registration, invite notification when a project owner invites a collaborator, and acceptance confirmation when an invite is accepted. Uses the Resend Python SDK with `asyncio.to_thread()` for async compatibility. Idempotency keys prevent duplicate sends. Gracefully no-ops when `RESEND_API_KEY` is not configured. New env vars: `RESEND_API_KEY`, `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL`, `APP_URL`
- **Session rotation** (`backend/app/services/session_summarizer.py`) — Automatic context-aware session rotation when chat history approaches the context window limit. Summarizes the old session via LLM, creates a new session with a continuation banner linking back to the original. Frontend `SessionContinuationBanner` component shows the transition. Cost estimate endpoint now includes `rotation_imminent` flag. Configurable via `SESSION_ROTATION_ENABLED`, `SESSION_ROTATION_THRESHOLD_PCT`, `SESSION_ROTATION_SUMMARY_MAX_TOKENS`
- **Context usage tracking in AgentResponse** — `context_usage_pct` field added to `AgentResponse` so the frontend can display how much of the context window has been consumed
- **Connection health auto-refresh** — `ConnectionHealth` component now auto-refreshes status periodically and shows more detailed health info
- **ChatMessage copy-all button** — New button on chat messages to copy the entire message content
- **GeoIP two-tier cache** (`backend/app/services/geoip_cache.py`) — In-memory LRU (100k entries, ~20MB) + SQLite persistent storage (`data/geoip_cache.db`, WAL mode, `WITHOUT ROWID`) for IP geolocation results. Eliminates redundant lookups across requests and survives process restarts. Handles millions of unique IPs. Batch operations deduplicate IPs and use batch SQL reads/writes. Configurable via `GEOIP_CACHE_ENABLED`, `GEOIP_CACHE_DIR`, `GEOIP_MEMORY_CACHE_SIZE` env vars
- **Data Processing meta-tool (`process_data`)** — Orchestrator tool that enriches query results with derived data between query steps. Enables multi-step analysis workflows (e.g., query DB for IPs, convert to countries, filter, aggregate). Supports chaining multiple operations sequentially
- **IP-to-country enrichment (`ip_to_country`)** — Offline GeoIP resolution using `geoip2fast` (MaxMind GeoLite2 database). Converts IP address columns to ISO country codes and country names with no external API calls
- **Phone-to-country enrichment (`phone_to_country`)** — Offline E.164 dialing code prefix resolution (~250 countries/territories) with Canadian area code disambiguation for US/CA differentiation within NANP +1 zone
- **In-memory aggregation (`aggregate_data`)** — Groups enriched data by one or more columns and computes `count`, `count_distinct`, `sum`, `avg`, `min`, `max`, `median`. **Multiple functions per column supported** (e.g., `amount:sum,amount:avg,*:count`). Optional `sort_by` / `order` params for controlling result ordering
- **Row filtering (`filter_data`)** — Post-enrichment row filtering by column value. Supports operators: `eq`, `neq`, `contains`, `not_contains`, `gt`, `gte`, `lt`, `lte`, `in`. Can exclude empty/null values with `exclude_empty`
- **`count_distinct` aggregation** — Counts unique non-null values in a column within each group (e.g., unique users per country)
- **`median` aggregation** — Computes median value for numeric columns within each group
- **GeoIPService** (`backend/app/services/geoip_service.py`) — Singleton service for offline IP geolocation lookups with graceful fallback when the library is unavailable
- **PhoneCountryService** (`backend/app/services/phone_country_service.py`) — Singleton service for offline phone number to country resolution via E.164 dialing codes, including Canadian area code disambiguation
- **DataProcessor** (`backend/app/services/data_processor.py`) — Pluggable data transformation engine that operates on `QueryResult` objects with four operations: `ip_to_country`, `phone_to_country`, `aggregate_data`, `filter_data`
- **Complex pipeline support** — `process_data` registered as a valid stage tool in `QueryPlanner` and `StageExecutor` for multi-stage queries (up to 10 stages). Stage executor parses structured JSON from `input_context` with fallback heuristics and emits fine-grained progress events
- **Sequential guard for `process_data`** — When `process_data` appears among parallel tool calls, the orchestrator forces sequential execution to prevent race conditions on shared `_last_sql_result` state
- **Aggregation visualization** — VizAgent is automatically triggered after `aggregate_data` to produce charts/tables for aggregated results
- **Cross-message enriched data persistence** — Enriched `QueryResult` survives across conversation turns for 5 minutes, enabling follow-up questions without re-running the full enrichment pipeline
- **Orchestrator iteration limit raised to 10** — Supports complex multi-enrichment workflows (e.g., dual-query call+SMS analysis with ip_to_country + phone_to_country + aggregate_data for each)

### Fixed
- **Google OAuth 403 on cross-origin** — CSRF double-submit cookie check in `/api/auth/google` now skips verification when the cookie is absent (cross-origin setup where frontend and API are on different domains). The nonce parameter already provides replay protection for the programmatic GIS callback flow
- **Heroku backup skip** — `BackupManager` now detects Heroku (`DYNO` env var) and skips `pg_dump` for managed Postgres, recommending `heroku pg:backups` instead
- **Noisy orchestrator context messages** — Replaced verbose SSE "thinking" events for context usage with quieter log-level messages to reduce UI clutter
- **LLM error formatting** — Improved error message formatting in LLM error classes
- **Registration race condition** — Concurrent duplicate email registrations now caught by DB `IntegrityError` and returned as 409 instead of 500
- **Invite accept commit on early return** — `accept_invite` now commits invite status change when user is already a project member, preventing the update from being silently rolled back
- **PATCH project response missing user_role** — `update_project` now returns a full `ProjectResponse` with `user_role` instead of the raw ORM object
- **Chat feedback learning trigger** — Negative feedback learning now triggers based on the clamped rating value instead of the raw request value, ensuring ratings like -2 or -5 still fire the learning pipeline
- **Reconnect handler connection leak** — `reconnect_connection` now always calls `connector.disconnect()` in a `finally` block, preventing connection/tunnel leaks on successful health checks
- **MCP connector TypeError on health check** — Reconnect and test-connection endpoints now gracefully handle MCP connections that don't support the `DatabaseAdapter` interface
- **Session rename title validation** — `SessionUpdate.title` now enforces `min_length=1` and `max_length=255` to prevent empty or oversized session titles
- **useRestoreState access detection** — `isAccessError` now detects permission errors by matching actual API error messages instead of just HTTP status code strings
- **Missing model imports** — Added 5 missing models (`BatchQuery`, `DataBenchmark`, `Dashboard`, `DataValidationFeedback`/`DataInvestigation`, `SessionNote`) to `models/__init__.py` for consistent mapper registration
- **Integration test auth for /health/modules** — Tests for the authenticated `GET /api/health/modules` endpoint now use `auth_client` instead of unauthenticated `client`
- **Performance smoke test limit for external API** — `test_models_list_latency` now uses a 2-second limit appropriate for the external OpenRouter API call instead of the 300ms internal-only limit
- **Mobile sidebar missing Dashboards** — Added Dashboards section to mobile sidebar drawer, matching desktop feature parity
- **DashboardBuilder JSON.parse crash** — Wrapped `visualization_json` parse in try/catch to prevent builder crash on malformed data
- **Investigation IDOR** — `get_investigation` and `confirm-fix` endpoints now verify the investigation's connection belongs to the requested project, preventing cross-project data access
- **SQL safety guard bypass** — UPDATE pattern now matches qualified table names (`schema.table`, `"schema"."table"`) and added MERGE/UPSERT DML patterns to read-only guard
- **Backend container runs as root** — Dockerfile.backend now creates a non-root `appuser` and runs the application with reduced privileges
- **Auth store localStorage consistency** — `storeAuth` now uses the safe-storage module matching the rest of the auth store, preventing partial state on Safari private mode
- **Pipeline end event not emitted** — Complex query and pipeline resume paths now emit `pipeline_end` event, preventing SSE streams from hanging indefinitely
- **SQL agent connector leak** — Connector cache now capped at 32 entries with LRU eviction and stale connector detection, preventing unbounded connection growth
- **Session title generation MissingGreenlet** — `generate_session_title` now uses explicit async query instead of triggering lazy-loaded relationship
- **Chat search LIKE injection** — Search term `%`, `_`, `\` characters now escaped before building LIKE pattern
- **WebSocket error information leak** — Error handler now sends generic message instead of raw exception string
- **SSE event regex mismatch** — Frontend SSE parser now matches hyphenated event names (e.g., `pipeline-end`)
- **ChatInput max length mismatch** — Frontend char limit raised from 4000 to 20000 to match backend
- **ChatMessage note state not reactive** — Note saved indicator now uses reactive Zustand subscription
- **Learning IDOR** — `update_learning` now verifies ownership before mutating, preventing cross-connection learning edits
- **MongoDB URI credential encoding** — Username and password now URL-encoded with `quote_plus` to handle special characters
- **SSH tunnel race condition** — Per-key asyncio locks prevent concurrent tunnel creation for the same config
- **ClickHouse password in process list** — Exec templates now pass password via environment variable instead of CLI argument
- **SSH key delete without user_id** — `delete()` now called with `user_id` for ownership verification consistency
- **Schedule pagination** — `list_schedules` and `get_history` endpoints now accept `skip`/`limit` query params
- **Alert conditions validation** — `alert_conditions` JSON validated as array with max_length; `notification_channels` capped
- **Result summary size cap** — Schedule run results truncated to 50 rows if JSON exceeds 1MB
- **Benchmark query unbounded** — `get_all_for_connection` now limited to 500 results

- **Connection service default limit** — `list_by_project` default reduced from 2000 to 200
- **Test connection error sanitization** — Error messages truncated to 500 chars to prevent internal detail leaks
- **Input validation hardening** — Added `max_length` to `LearningUpdate.lesson`, `SshKeyCreate.passphrase`, `mcp_env` size limits
- **Orchestrator fire-and-forget warning** — `ensure_future` callback now retrieves exceptions to suppress "Task exception was never retrieved" warnings
- **Default rules protection** — Default rules (system-generated) now return 403 on update/delete attempts, preventing accidental corruption
- **Shared notes access broken** — `get_note` and `execute_note` now use `_require_note_access` which allows project members to access shared notes (previously always returned 403)
- **NoteCard comment editing for non-owners** — Comment section now read-only for non-owners, preventing guaranteed 403 failures
- **Viz endpoint DoS** — `RenderRequest` rows capped at 10K, `ExportRequest` at 50K, columns at 500 to prevent server OOM
- **Dashboard update/delete membership check** — Both endpoints now verify project membership before checking creator ownership
- **Session notes unbounded queries** — `_find_similar` capped at 100 candidates, `get_notes_for_context` capped at 200 with 50-note default return
- **Rules rate limiting** — Added rate limits to `list_rules` (60/min) and `update_rule` (20/min)
- **Dashboard refresh parallelized** — `handleRefreshAll` now uses `Promise.allSettled` instead of sequential awaits
- **DashboardBuilder noteMap memoization** — `noteMap` wrapped in `useMemo` to prevent needless re-renders
- **Frontend input maxLength** — Added maxLength to RulesManager name/content, DashboardBuilder title inputs
- **ChartRenderer unknown type fallback** — Shows descriptive message instead of blank rectangle for unsupported chart types

### Security
- **Auth register error sanitization** — Register endpoint no longer exposes internal ValueError messages; returns static "already exists" message while logging details server-side
- **Rate limits on write endpoints** — Added rate limits to 7 previously unprotected mutation endpoints (PATCH projects, PATCH/DELETE sessions, generate-title, feedback, mark notification read, delete SSH key)
- **Probe service SQL injection hardening** — Tightened `_VALID_TABLE_RE` regex to reject quote characters; added `_quote_identifier()` with proper double-quote escaping per SQL standard
- **WebSocket input validation** — Chat WebSocket handler now validates incoming JSON with `WsChatMessage` Pydantic model (enforces message length, provider/model max_length)
- **Credentials cleanup** — Deleted local `notes.md` containing plaintext DB password and SSH private key (never committed to git history)

### Fixed
- **LLM health checks activated** — `start_health_checks()` now called on app startup; failed providers auto-marked unhealthy and skipped in fallback chain until recovered
- **Connector query result row cap** — All 4 DB connectors now cap results at 10,000 rows with `truncated` flag, preventing OOM on large result sets
- **useRestoreState race condition** — Sequence counter prevents stale restore data from overwriting user's active project selection during rapid switching
- **Misleading reconnect banner** — ChatPanel connection-down banner now says "Click Retry to reconnect" instead of the inaccurate "Attempting reconnect..."
- **Form input length limits** — Added maxLength to all text inputs in OnboardingWizard and ConnectionSelector (hosts, ports, credentials, URLs, commands)
- **Connector query timeout** — All connectors now use `settings.query_timeout_seconds` (default 30s) instead of hardcoded 120s
- **Workflow tracker synchronization** — `subscribe()` and `unsubscribe()` now async and acquire `_lock`, matching `_broadcast`'s locking discipline
- **Error boundary logging** — Both ErrorBoundary and SectionErrorBoundary now log caught errors with component stack via `componentDidCatch`
- **WebSocket token usage tracking** — WebSocket chat path now records LLM token usage via UsageService, matching HTTP `/ask` and `/ask/stream` endpoints (costs were previously untracked for WS users)
- **Toast notification cap** — Toasts limited to 5 max; oldest evicted when exceeded (prevents screen flooding during network failures)
- **Unbounded message loading** — `ChatService.get_session()` no longer eagerly loads all messages via `selectinload`; messages now fetched with DB-level LIMIT/OFFSET
- **SSH tunnel cleanup on connection delete** — `ConnectionService.delete()` now closes associated SSH tunnels across all connector types, preventing tunnel accumulation
- **localStorage Safari compatibility** — All localStorage access across 9 files wrapped in try/catch to prevent crashes in Safari private browsing mode
- **JWT expiry zombie state** — `scheduleRefresh` now triggers immediate logout with toast when token is already expired, instead of silently returning
- **WrongDataModal focus trap** — Tab key now cycles within the modal when open, preventing keyboard users from tabbing into background content
- **SSE stream deduplication** — `ConnectionHealth` components now use a shared event bus instead of each opening its own SSE stream to `/workflows/events`
- **Connector pool leak** — All 4 DB connectors (Postgres, MySQL, MongoDB, ClickHouse) now close existing pool/client in `connect()` before creating new ones, preventing connection leaks on repeated connect calls
- **Silent exceptions in sql_agent.py** — Added `logger.debug(exc_info=True)` to 13 previously silent `except` blocks in context-loading helpers, making failures diagnosable from logs
- **ConnectionHealth loading state** — Component now shows pulsing indicator during initial health check instead of immediately displaying "unknown" status
- **Accessibility** — Added `aria-label` attributes to 3 inputs in `ClarificationCard` and `MetricCatalogPanel` that only had placeholder text

### Added
- **Frontend API retry** — GET/HEAD requests automatically retry up to 2 times on network errors and 502/503/504 with exponential backoff; mutation methods (POST/PATCH/DELETE) never retry
- **TTLCache utility** — Generic TTL + LRU cache class (`app/core/ttl_cache.py`) with bounded size and time-based expiry
- **Safe storage utility** — `safe-storage.ts` module with try/catch-wrapped localStorage helpers
- **SSE event bus** — Local pub/sub (`broadcastEvent`/`onEvent`) in `sse.ts` for sharing SSE events without duplicate streams
- **Custom 404 page** — Branded `not-found.tsx` with dark theme styling and link back to home
- **Focus refresh** — `useRefreshOnFocus` hook re-fetches projects, connections, and sessions when browser tab regains focus (throttled to once per 30 seconds)

### Performance
- **Agent cache LRU eviction** — `sql_agent` and `knowledge_agent` caches now use TTLCache with max_size=128, preventing unbounded memory growth over long runtimes
- **Lazy-loaded react-markdown** — `ChatMessage.tsx` and `SQLExplainer.tsx` now use `next/dynamic` to load `react-markdown` on demand as a separate chunk

### Changed
- CI coverage threshold raised from 69% to 72%
- **Chat feedback redesign** — Removed quick-action chips, FollowupChips, DataValidationCard, and WrongDataModal from chat messages. Thumbs up/down now record data validation and thumbs down auto-triggers agent investigation in chat
- **Sidebar "+New" redesign** — Moved all "+New" buttons from section content into section header "+" icons that appear only when expanded. Applies to Projects, Connections, Chat History, Rules, Schedules, and Dashboards

### Security
- **KnowledgeAgent cache isolation** — Fixed critical cross-project data leakage where cached knowledge could bleed between projects (single-slot cache → dict keyed by project_id)
- **MCP connection IDOR** — Added project ownership check before using MCP connections in orchestrator
- **SafetyGuard on diagnostic queries** — Investigation agent `run_diagnostic_query` now validates SQL through SafetyGuard before execution
- **SafetyGuard on schedule run-now** — Manual schedule execution now applies the same safety checks as the cron scheduler
- **Rate limiting** — Added rate limits to `/visualizations/render`, `/exploration`, `/semantic-layer`, `/reconciliation`, `/temporal` endpoints

### Fixed

- **Query timeouts** — MySQL and ClickHouse connectors now enforce 120s query timeout via asyncio.wait_for, preventing pool exhaustion from long-running queries
- **Connector disconnect safety** — All 6 connectors (postgres, mysql, mongodb, clickhouse, mcp, ssh_exec) now use try/finally in disconnect() to always clear handles even when teardown throws
- **Keyboard shortcut conflict** — Removed duplicate Cmd/Ctrl+K handler from ChatInput; ChatSearch now exclusively owns the shortcut

- **Graceful shutdown** — Indexing and sync background tasks are now cancelled during app shutdown
- **seedActiveTasks race** — useGlobalEvents checks active flag before writing to store, preventing stale seed after disconnect
- **Markdown image blocking** — ChatMessage and SQLExplainer now block markdown img tags to prevent arbitrary external image requests
- **Suggestion stale closure** — ChatPanel suggestion reset now depends on activeProject?.id, ensuring suggestions reload on project switch
- **ConnectionHealth feedback** — Reconnect failure now shows error toast instead of silently swallowing errors
- **Silent exceptions** — Added debug logging to remaining silent except blocks (WebSocket send, OpenRouter error body, tunnel introspection)
- **Input validation** — Added max_length constraints to ConnectionCreate (10+ fields) and ProjectUpdate (10 fields)
- **localStorage quota safety** — Wrapped localStorage.setItem calls in auth-store and app-store with try/catch to handle QuotaExceededError gracefully
- **useRestoreState race** — Added cancellation flag to prevent stale async restore results from overwriting store after unmount or auth change
- **ProjectSelector race** — Added sequence counter to discard out-of-order API responses when rapidly switching projects
- **Health endpoint depth** — /api/health now verifies DB connectivity (SELECT 1), returns 503 when database is unreachable
- **Graceful shutdown** — Indexing and sync background tasks from connections/repos routes are now cancelled during shutdown
- **seedActiveTasks race** — useGlobalEvents seedActiveTasks now checks active flag before writing to store, preventing stale seed after disconnect
- Recreated backend venv to fix stale shebangs from old project path
- **InsightFeedPanel** now shows "Couldn't load insights" with Retry when API fails (previously showed misleading empty state)
- **DashboardList** now shows "Couldn't load dashboards" with Retry when API fails (previously showed misleading empty state)
- **ConnectionSelector** now shows "No connections yet" empty state when no connections exist
- **VizRenderer** now shows "Visualization data unavailable" instead of rendering nothing when payload is missing
- **SSE stream completion guard** — Chat stream now fires `onError` if server ends without result/error event, preventing stuck loading state
- **DataValidationCard** — Removed premature optimistic `setVerdict` before API confirmation; UI only updates on success
- **AccountMenu** — Added Escape key handler for keyboard dismissal
- **RetryStrategy** — Fixed empty repair hints when COLUMN_NOT_FOUND has no suggested columns
- **Sidebar callbacks** — Replaced 11 inline lambdas with stable useCallback refs to prevent unnecessary child effect re-runs
- **Notes store** — `loadNotes` failure now shows toast error instead of silent empty state
- **Silent exceptions** — Added debug logging to 10+ previously silent `except: pass` blocks across chat, connectors, and agent modules
- **Accessibility** — Added dialog semantics to BatchRunner, aria-labels to icon-only buttons and form inputs across 6 components
- **Performance** — Narrowed Zustand selectors in 17+ components to prevent full-store re-renders
- **test_alembic.py** — use `sys.executable -m alembic` instead of bare `alembic` CLI to avoid picking up system Python outside venv

### Fixed
- **Sidebar popup overflow** — NotificationBell dropdown, AccountMenu, and Tooltip now render via React portals (`PopoverPortal`) to escape sidebar `overflow-hidden`, preventing clipping on desktop collapsed/expanded states
- **Charts missing in Saved Queries** — NoteCard now renders `VizRenderer` (bar/line/pie/scatter charts) from `visualization_json` in a collapsible "Chart" section
- **Refresh-to-chat** — Clicking "Refresh" on a saved query now posts the refreshed result as a message in the currently active chat session (with `[Refreshed]` prefix)
- **Critical: Router prefix duplication** — Sprint 1 routes (reconciliation, semantic-layer, explore, temporal) had double-prefixed paths (e.g. `/api/reconciliation/reconciliation/...`) causing 404s from frontend. Removed redundant router-level prefix.
- **Security: Cross-project insight access** — confirm/dismiss/resolve insight endpoints now verify the insight belongs to the target project before mutation, preventing cross-project data manipulation.
- **Feed API empty responses** — `scan_opportunities` and `scan_losses` now return `insights_stored: 0` when no DB entries exist, matching frontend DTO expectations.
- **Next.js viewport metadata deprecation** — moved `themeColor` and `viewport` from `metadata` export to proper `viewport` export per Next.js 15 API, eliminating build warnings.
- **Float conversion safety** — added `_safe_float` utility in action_engine and exploration_engine to handle `None`, non-numeric, and string confidence values without crashing.
- **Reconciliation schema handling** — `reconcile_schemas` now handles `None` column lists gracefully with `set(schema.get(table) or [])`.
- **Feed HTTPException consistency** — replaced inline `from fastapi import HTTPException` with top-level import and keyword args for consistency.

### Changed
- Test coverage increased from 68.90% to 71.03%
- Added integration tests for Sprint 1 route path reachability (reconciliation, semantic-layer, explore, temporal)
- Added integration test for cross-project insight access prevention
- Added unit tests for `_safe_float` edge cases and `None`/non-numeric confidence handling
