The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- **Orchestrator `steps_used` always same** — Fixed dead ternary `iteration + 1 if step_limit_hit else iteration + 1` (both branches identical); now correctly reports `iteration` when the agent finished before the step limit
- **SPAN_TYPE_MAP stale tool names** — Updated trace span classification keys to match actual knowledge agent tools (`search_knowledge` instead of `search_codebase`, `get_entity_info` instead of `get_entity_details`) and SQL agent tool (`get_sync_context` instead of `get_sync_status`); removed non-existent `list_entities` entry
- **Tautological test assertion** — Fixed `assert ... or True` in `test_persists_when_project_id_empty` that always passed regardless of actual condition
- **ARCHITECTURE.md wrong API paths** — Corrected traced request paths (`/ask` → `/api/chat/ask`, `/ws/chat` → `/api/chat/ws/{project}/{connection}`) and health endpoint path (`/health` → `/api/health`)
- **CHANGELOG duplicate entries** — Removed 5 duplicate fix entries (useRestoreState race, ProjectSelector race, Health endpoint, Graceful shutdown, seedActiveTasks race)
- **deploy.yml checkout ref** — Added `ref: ${{ github.event.workflow_run.head_sha }}` to ensure CI-validated commit is deployed, not whatever is on the default branch at deploy time
- **deploy-heroku.sh exit code** — Unknown CLI options now exit 1 instead of falling through to `usage()` which exits 0
- **`.env.example` wrong default** — Fixed `STREAM_SAFETY_MARGIN_SECONDS` comment from 30 to 90 to match actual `config.py` default
- **Clarification flow broken end-to-end** — The `ask_user` tool's structured data (question type, options, context) was lost in transit from orchestrator to frontend because `clarification_data` was stored in `viz_config` but never mapped to the API response. Added a dedicated `clarification_data` field to `AgentResponse`, `ChatResponse`, and all three response paths (REST, SSE, WebSocket). The `ClarificationCard` UI (yes/no, multiple choice, free text, numeric range) now renders correctly with structured data
- **`ask_user` unavailable without DB connection** — The `ask_user` tool was gated behind `has_connection=True` in `get_orchestrator_tools()`, preventing clarification questions for knowledge-only projects. Moved `ask_user` to be always available regardless of connected capabilities

### Improved
- **Proactive request analysis** — Added "REQUEST ANALYSIS PROTOCOL" to the orchestrator system prompt instructing the LLM to assess request ambiguity, check schema/knowledge coverage, and use `ask_user` proactively before executing tools. Previously the prompt only encouraged post-query verification

### Fixed
- **Lost error traces** — Failed requests that crashed before `pipeline_end` was emitted now always appear in the Logs screen with full step breakdown and error details. Six root causes fixed: (1) `ConversationalAgent.run()` now wraps the orchestrator call in `try/except/finally` with a safety-net `pipeline_end` emission via `WorkflowTracker.has_ended()`; (2) Orchestrator `_resume_pipeline` early return ("pipeline not found") now calls `tracker.end()`; (3) Non-streaming `POST /ask` wraps `_agent.run()` in `try/except` to call `finalize_trace()` on crash; (4) `_persist_workflow` no longer silently drops traces with empty `project_id`/`user_id` — they are persisted with empty IDs and `finalize_trace()` updates later; (5) `_cleanup_stale_buffers` persists stale buffers as failed traces (synthetic `pipeline_end`) instead of discarding them; (6) Streaming `_finalize_on_error` uses a fallback workflow ID when the original is `None`, and the "no result" branch now surfaces the actual task exception
- **Trace persistence FK violation** — `_persist_workflow` now persists traces even when `project_id` or `user_id` are missing from the workflow context, using empty strings as placeholders. `finalize_trace()` later updates these rows with correct IDs. This replaces the earlier approach of skipping persistence entirely, which caused error traces to be lost
- **SSE stream cut off on complex queries** — Increased `stream_safety_margin_seconds` from 30 to 90 (total deadline 210s) to accommodate multi-step agent workflows that exceed 150s, preventing premature "SSE event loop exceeded safety timeout" breaks

### Improved
- **Enriched trace spans** — Trace spans in the Request Logs screen now include full step-by-step data: LLM prompt/response previews with token counts and model info, SQL query text and result summaries, RAG search inputs/outputs, sub-agent delegation details, and validation step data. Noise events (`token`, `thinking`, `orchestrator:warning`, `orchestrator:llm_retry`) are filtered out. Duplicate `execute_query` spans removed. `WorkflowTracker.step()` now accepts a `step_data` dict for capturing enrichment data inside context managers. `SPAN_TYPE_MAP` expanded with all agent step names for accurate classification. Fallback `_build_spans_from_tool_log` now handles both `args`/`result` and `arguments`/`result_preview` key formats. Initial trace creation now includes `project_id` and `user_id` from `begin()` context
- **Complete trace capture** — Fixed multiple gaps where requests bypassed trace persistence: WebSocket chat now calls `finalize_trace()` after each message; SSE streaming error/timeout/cancel paths now finalize traces with `status=failed`; MCP tools (`query_database`, `search_codebase`) switched from isolated `WorkflowTracker()` instances to the singleton tracker so events reach `TracePersistenceService`; data validation investigation agent switched to singleton tracker with `project_id` context; batch execute now includes `project_id` and `user_id` in `tracker.begin()` context; standalone LLM endpoints (`generate-title`, `explain-sql`, `summarize`) now create lightweight traces with proper pipeline names. Request list in Logs screen now shows user display names when viewing all users, and date range filter is passed to the request list API call for consistency with summary/user sidebar time windows

### Fixed
- **Markdown table rendering in chat** — Added `remark-gfm` plugin to `react-markdown` so GFM pipe tables (`| col | col |`) generated by the LLM are rendered as proper HTML tables instead of raw text. Affects `ChatMessage.tsx`, `ChatPanel.tsx` (streaming), and `SQLExplainer.tsx`
- **Streaming text markdown** — Streaming (in-progress) assistant messages now render through `ReactMarkdown` with GFM support instead of plain `<p>` tag, so tables/bold/lists display correctly while generating
- **Backend tool result formatting** — `_format_query_results` in `sql_agent.py` and `tool_executor.py` now produces proper GFM markdown tables (with header + separator rows) instead of bare pipe-separated lines, improving LLM output quality
- **Table CSS layout** — Removed `display: block` from `.chat-markdown table` in `globals.css` which broke native table column alignment; overflow scrolling is now handled by the wrapper `<div>` in `mdComponents`

### Added
- **Request Logs screen (owner-only)** — New full-panel logs screen accessible from the sidebar that shows every chat request as a structured trace. Features: KPI summary cards (total requests, success rate, failed count, LLM calls, DB queries, avg latency, cost), user filter panel, paginated request list with status/type badges, and expandable trace detail view showing the full orchestrator route with individual spans (LLM calls, DB queries, sub-agent steps, validation, RAG). Each span displays type icon, duration, token count, and error details. New `request_traces` and `trace_spans` DB tables persist orchestrator workflow events via `TracePersistenceService`. New `/api/logs/` endpoints with owner-only access control. Date range filter (7d/14d/30d/90d) and status filter (All/Completed/Failed)
- **Usage API server-side authorization** — `/api/usage/stats` now enforces owner-level access when `project_id` query param is provided (previously only frontend-gated)
- **Project creation eligibility gate** — New `can_create_projects` flag on users table (default `false`). Only eligible users can create projects on the hosted version; others see a "Request Access" modal with email/description/message form that sends a request to `contact@checkmydata.ai`. Backend enforces with 403 on `POST /api/projects`. New `POST /api/projects/access-requests` endpoint. Admin emails (configured via `ADMIN_EMAILS` env var) are seeded with `can_create_projects=true` via Alembic migration. Non-eligible users can still join projects via invite or use the self-hosted version
- **Analytics & Usage RBAC** — Analytics (`GET /chat/analytics/feedback/{pid}`, `GET /data-validation/analytics/{pid}`, `GET /data-validation/summary/{pid}`) and Usage sidebar panels are now restricted to project **owners** only. Non-owners no longer see these sections in the sidebar
- **Dashboard RBAC** — Dashboard create/edit/delete operations now require at least **editor** role. Viewers can list and view shared dashboards but cannot modify them. The "New dashboard" sidebar action and Edit button on dashboard pages are hidden for viewers. Any editor/owner can edit or delete any dashboard in their project (not just the creator)
- **`FormModal` component** (`frontend/src/components/ui/FormModal.tsx`) — Reusable modal shell with title bar, close (X) button, Escape key, backdrop click dismiss, focus trap, and scroll support
- **KnowledgeResult.sources populated** — RAG search results now correctly wire `RAGSource` objects into `KnowledgeResult.sources`, enabling citation display in chat
- **Global learning patterns** — `AgentLearningService` now identifies learnings that appear across 2+ connections and promotes them into every connection's prompt as universal patterns
- **Pre-call token estimation** — `LLMRouter.estimate_tokens()` uses tiktoken (OpenAI-accurate) with char-based fallback for pre-call context budgeting
- **Knowledge quality scoring** — `RAGFeedbackService` now computes per-source quality scores combining success rate and average retrieval distance, and identifies low-quality sources for re-indexing
- **Persistent query cache** — `QueryCache` supports optional file-based persistence via `query_cache_persist_dir` config, surviving process restarts
- **Incremental schema diff** — `SchemaInfo.fingerprint()` and `SchemaInfo.diff()` enable comparing schemas to detect only changed tables, avoiding full re-introspection
- **Token budget caps** — `UsageService.check_budget()` enforces configurable daily/monthly token limits per user with `BudgetExceededError` and remaining-budget reporting
- **Landing page and full branding** — New public landing page at `/` with hero section, feature grid (6 cards), how-it-works flow, open-source CTA, and supported databases banner. Dark theme using existing design system tokens with JSON-LD structured data for SEO
- **Marketing layout** — Shared `(marketing)` route group layout with sticky blurred header (logo, nav, Login, Get Started CTA) and 4-column footer (Product, Legal, Community links)
- **Dedicated login page** (`/login`) — Standalone authentication page with CheckMyData.ai branding replacing the inline AuthGate form. Supports email/password and Google OAuth
- **About page** (`/about`) — Product mission, technology stack overview, and open-source philosophy
- **Contact page** (`/contact`) — Email channels (contact@checkmydata.ai, support@checkmydata.ai) and GitHub community links
- **Support page** (`/support`) — FAQ with expandable details, documentation links, and support channels
- **Branding assets** — Generated favicon.ico, icon-192.png, icon-512.png, apple-touch-icon.png, og-image.png (1200x630), and reusable `Logo.tsx` SVG component (`LogoMark` + `LogoFull` variants)
- **SEO infrastructure** — robots.txt (disallows /app and /dashboard), dynamic sitemap.xml via Next.js `sitemap.ts`, `metadataBase` on root layout, canonical URLs and OG/Twitter Card metadata on all pages

### Fixed
- **Authenticated user landing redirect** — Added `AuthRedirect` client component to the landing page so authenticated users visiting `/` are automatically redirected to `/app` instead of seeing the marketing page

### Changed
- **Custom Rules editor enlarged** — Rule edit/create modal widened from `max-w-lg` (512px) to `max-w-3xl` (768px) with a taller monospaced textarea (rows=12, min-h-200px) for comfortable markdown editing
- **Agent Learnings popup** — LearningsPanel converted from an inline accordion inside the sidebar to a centered `FormModal` popup (`max-w-3xl`) with 60vh scroll area, larger text, and roomier edit textareas
- **Sidebar forms → centered modals** — All 6 sidebar create/edit forms (Project, Connection, SSH key, Rule, Schedule, Dashboard) now open as centered pop-up modals instead of rendering inline in the sidebar
- **StageValidator configurable strictness** — Min/max row count checks can now fail (not just warn) via `strict_row_bounds` flag
- **SSH tunnel idle cleanup** — `SSHTunnelManager` now tracks last-used time per tunnel and closes idle tunnels (default 30min TTL)
- **Parallel batch queries** — `BatchService.execute_batch()` now runs queries concurrently (up to 4 parallel, configurable)
- **Expanded rule-based viz** — `VizAgent` now handles more cases without LLM calls: auto-detects pie/bar/line charts for common data shapes
- **Deprecated orchestrator decoupled** — `core/orchestrator.py` is no longer imported by any production code
- **Route restructure** — Main application moved from `/` to `/app`. Unauthenticated users see the landing page at `/` instead of a login form
- **AuthGate simplified** — Reduced from 293-line login form to a 42-line redirect guard that sends unauthenticated users to `/login`
- **Legal pages moved** — `/terms` and `/privacy` migrated from `(legal)` to `(marketing)` route group to share the common header/footer
- **401 redirect** — Session-expired handler in `api.ts` now redirects to `/login` instead of `/`
- **manifest.json** — Updated `start_url` to `/app`, added enhanced description

### Added
- **Adaptive step budget system** — Replaced the hard 10-iteration orchestrator ceiling with an adaptive step budget (default 25). The LLM is now informed when it's running low on steps via a step-budget-aware wrap-up prompt (`orchestrator_wrap_up_steps`). When exhausted, a final LLM synthesis call (`orchestrator_final_synthesis`) produces a coherent summary instead of a static "maximum steps reached" message.
- **Continuation protocol** — When the step limit is reached, the response includes `response_type: "step_limit_reached"` with `steps_used`, `steps_total`, and `continuation_context`. The frontend renders a "Continue analysis" button that lets users resume the analysis from where it left off.
- **Per-project and per-request step overrides** — Added `max_orchestrator_steps` column to the `Project` model and `max_steps` field to the chat request body. Resolution order: request `max_steps` > project `max_orchestrator_steps` > global `max_orchestrator_iterations`.
- **Consistent sub-agent iteration limits** — `KnowledgeAgent` and `InvestigationAgent` now use `settings.max_knowledge_iterations` and `settings.max_investigation_iterations` instead of hardcoded class constants. `MAX_SUB_AGENT_RETRIES` in the orchestrator uses `settings.max_sub_agent_retries`.
- **Orchestrator prompt efficiency guideline** — Added a tool-usage efficiency guideline to the orchestrator system prompt encouraging the LLM to combine related questions and parallelize independent tool calls.

### Fixed
- **Email service security and reliability hardening** (`backend/app/services/email_service.py`) — Fixed HTML injection vulnerability: all user-provided values (`display_name`, `project_name`, `inviter_name`, etc.) are now HTML-escaped via `html.escape()` before interpolation into email templates. Added retry with exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s) for transient Resend errors (429 rate-limit, 500 server error), max 3 retries. Moved `resend.api_key` assignment from every `_send()` call to `__init__()`. Email send results now log the Resend email ID for traceability. Added category tags (`welcome`, `invite`, `invite-accepted`) for Resend dashboard analytics.
- **ARQ worker crash** — `run_db_index` and `run_code_db_sync` worker tasks referenced non-existent service methods (`set_indexing_status_standalone`, `index_connection`, `run_sync_standalone`). Rewrote both to use `DbIndexPipeline` and `CodeDbSyncPipeline` with proper session management. Fixes #128
- **ReadinessBanner stale state** — Banner showing "index outdated" from a previous project was never cleared on project switch. Now resets `staleInfo` to null when the new project is not stale. Fixes #129
- **WrongDataModal empty connection_id** — Investigation form sent `connection_id: ""` when no DB connection was selected, causing 422 errors. Now validates connection and shows user-friendly toast. Fixes #130
- **useGlobalEvents null workflow_id crash** — `toLogEntry` called `.slice()` on potentially null `workflow_id`, crashing SSE event processing. Added null-safe fallback. Fixes #131
- **Traceback logging in task callbacks** — 5 files passed exception instances to `exc_info=` in asyncio task done callbacks where `sys.exc_info()` is empty. Changed to explicit `(type, value, traceback)` tuples for reliable stack traces. Fixes #132
- **chat.py missing ConnectionConfig import** — Added `TYPE_CHECKING` import for `ConnectionConfig`, resolving ruff F821 and mypy name-defined errors. Fixes #133
- **Ruff lint violations** — Resolved all E501 (line too long) and I001 (import sorting) across `chat.py`, `task_queue.py`, `main.py`, `email_service.py`. `ruff check app/` now passes clean. Fixes #134
- **Logout state leak** — Sign-out now resets all Zustand stores (app, notes, log, task) preventing previous user's chat messages and project data from persisting in memory. Fixes #135
- **Knowledge agent raw tool fallback** — When max iterations exhausted, fallback now uses the last assistant message instead of raw tool output. Fixes #136
- **task_queue.py mypy regression** — Fixed `exc_info` tuple type by adding explicit None guard on `t.exception()`. Fixes #137
- **SSE premature connected flag** — Removed eager `setConnected(true)` after subscription setup; connected state now only set on first received event. Fixes #138
- **Orchestrator shared SQL state** — Per-request SQL results (`_last_sql_result`) scoped per `workflow_id` to prevent data leakage between concurrent requests. Fixes #139

### Added
- **Design system documentation** (`DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`) — Comprehensive visual guide covering semantic color tokens, typography scale, spacing, border-radius, shadows, icons, button variants, form inputs, cards, modals, tooltips, toasts, status indicators, animations, responsive rules, and accessibility guidelines
- **Frontend design system skill** (`.cursor/skills/frontend-design-system/SKILL.md`) — Cursor agent skill that enforces design system compliance on all future frontend work
- **Celery worker infrastructure** (`backend/app/worker.py`, `backend/app/core/task_queue.py`, `backend/app/core/cache.py`) — Redis-backed task queue with shared cache layer for background job processing

### Changed
- **Full design system migration** (68 frontend files) — Migrated all raw Tailwind palette classes (`zinc-*`, `blue-*`, `red-*`, `emerald-*`, `amber-*`, `purple-*`, etc.) to semantic design tokens (`surface-*`, `text-*`, `border-*`, `accent`, `success`, `error`, `warning`, `info`). Zero raw palette classes remain in component files
- **Typography scale enforcement** — Eliminated all off-scale font sizes: `text-[8px]`/`text-[9px]` → `text-[10px]`, `text-[11.5px]` → `text-[11px]`, `text-[12px]`/`text-[13px]` → `text-sm`, legal page h1 `text-3xl` → `text-2xl`
- **Card/panel border-radius standardization** — All card and panel containers now use `rounded-xl`; form inputs use `rounded-lg`; modals use `rounded-lg`
- **Modal accessibility** — OnboardingWizard now has `role="dialog"`, `aria-modal="true"`, `aria-labelledby`, focus trap, and Escape-to-close. WrongDataModal updated with `aria-labelledby` and correct shadow level
- **Toast styling** — Success/error/info toast variants now use semantic tokens instead of raw palette colors
- **Button focus rings** — ConfirmModal Cancel/Confirm buttons now have `focus-visible:ring` styles
- **Shadow standardization** — Eliminated `shadow-2xl` (modals → `shadow-xl`), `shadow-md` (LogPanel toggle → `shadow-lg`)
- **Batch service refactored** for Celery task queue support with improved error handling

### Fixed
- **Missing ARIA labels** — Added `aria-label` to icon-only buttons in InviteManager, LearningsPanel, ScheduleManager, NoteCard, DashboardBuilder, AccountMenu, LlmModelSelector, and OnboardingWizard
- **Missing `transition-colors`** — Added smooth color transitions to interactive elements in StageProgress, Sidebar, NotificationBell
- **ActionCard `aria-expanded`** — Expand/collapse button now correctly announces its state to screen readers
- **ConfirmModal typing input** — Added `aria-label` for the confirmation phrase input
- **SessionContinuationBanner invalid tokens** — Fixed references to non-existent tokens (`text-text-2`, `bg-border`) → valid semantic tokens
- **Test assertions updated** — VerificationBadge and ConfirmModal tests updated to match semantic token class names

### Added
- **Transactional emails via Resend** (`backend/app/services/email_service.py`) — Three email types: welcome email on registration, invite notification when a project owner invites a collaborator, and acceptance confirmation when an invite is accepted. Uses the Resend Python SDK with `asyncio.to_thread()` for async compatibility. Idempotency keys prevent duplicate sends. Gracefully no-ops when `RESEND_API_KEY` is not configured. New env vars: `RESEND_API_KEY`, `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL`, `APP_URL`
- **Session rotation** (`backend/app/services/session_summarizer.py`) — Automatic context-aware session rotation when chat history approaches the context window limit. Summarizes the old session via LLM, creates a new session with a continuation banner linking back to the original. Frontend `SessionContinuationBanner` component shows the transition. Cost estimate endpoint now includes `rotation_imminent` flag. Configurable via `SESSION_ROTATION_ENABLED`, `SESSION_ROTATION_THRESHOLD_PCT`, `SESSION_ROTATION_SUMMARY_MAX_TOKENS`
- **Context usage tracking in AgentResponse** — `context_usage_pct` field added to `AgentResponse` so the frontend can display how much of the context window has been consumed
- **Connection health auto-refresh** — `ConnectionHealth` component now auto-refreshes status periodically and shows more detailed health info
- **ChatMessage copy-all button** — New button on chat messages to copy the entire message content
- **GeoIP two-tier cache** (`backend/app/services/geoip_cache.py`) — In-memory LRU (100k entries, ~20MB) + SQLite persistent storage (`data/geoip_cache.db`, WAL mode, `WITHOUT ROWID`) for IP geolocation results. Eliminates redundant lookups across requests and survives process restarts. Handles millions of unique IPs. Batch operations deduplicate IPs and use batch SQL reads/writes. Configurable via `GEOIP_CACHE_ENABLED`, `GEOIP_CACHE_DIR`, `GEOIP_MEMORY_CACHE_SIZE` env vars
- **Data Processing meta-tool (`process_data`)** — Orchestrator tool that enriches query results with derived data between query steps. Enables multi-step analysis workflows (e.g., query DB for IPs, convert to countries, filter, aggregate). Supports chaining multiple operations sequentially
- **IP-to-country enrichment (`ip_to_country`)** — Offline GeoIP resolution using `geoip2fast` (MaxMind GeoLite2 database). Converts IP address columns to ISO country codes and country names with no external API calls
- **Phone-to-country enrichment (`phone_to_country`)** — Offline E.164 dialing code prefix resolution (~250 countries/territories) with Canadian area code disambiguation for US/CA differentiation within NANP +1 zone
- **In-memory aggregation (`aggregate_data`)** — Groups enriched data by one or more columns and computes `count`, `count_distinct`, `sum`, `avg`, `min`, `max`, `median`. **Multiple functions per column supported** (e.g., `amount:sum,amount:avg,*:count`). Optional `sort_by` / `order` params for controlling result ordering
- **Row filtering (`filter_data`)** — Post-enrichment row filtering by column value. Supports operators: `eq`, `neq`, `contains`, `not_contains`, `gt`, `gte`, `lt`, `lte`, `in`. Can exclude empty/null values with `exclude_empty`
- **`count_distinct` aggregation** — Counts unique non-null values in a column within each group (e.g., unique users per country)
- **`median` aggregation** — Computes median value for numeric columns within each group
- **GeoIPService** (`backend/app/services/geoip_service.py`) — Singleton service for offline IP geolocation lookups with graceful fallback when the library is unavailable
- **PhoneCountryService** (`backend/app/services/phone_country_service.py`) — Singleton service for offline phone number to country resolution via E.164 dialing codes, including Canadian area code disambiguation
- **DataProcessor** (`backend/app/services/data_processor.py`) — Pluggable data transformation engine that operates on `QueryResult` objects with four operations: `ip_to_country`, `phone_to_country`, `aggregate_data`, `filter_data`
- **Complex pipeline support** — `process_data` registered as a valid stage tool in `QueryPlanner` and `StageExecutor` for multi-stage queries (up to 10 stages). Stage executor parses structured JSON from `input_context` with fallback heuristics and emits fine-grained progress events
- **Sequential guard for `process_data`** — When `process_data` appears among parallel tool calls, the orchestrator forces sequential execution to prevent race conditions on shared `_last_sql_result` state
- **Aggregation visualization** — VizAgent is automatically triggered after `aggregate_data` to produce charts/tables for aggregated results
- **Cross-message enriched data persistence** — Enriched `QueryResult` survives across conversation turns for 5 minutes, enabling follow-up questions without re-running the full enrichment pipeline
- **Orchestrator iteration limit raised to 10** — Supports complex multi-enrichment workflows (e.g., dual-query call+SMS analysis with ip_to_country + phone_to_country + aggregate_data for each)

### Fixed
- **Google OAuth 403 on cross-origin** — CSRF double-submit cookie check in `/api/auth/google` now skips verification when the cookie is absent (cross-origin setup where frontend and API are on different domains). The nonce parameter already provides replay protection for the programmatic GIS callback flow
- **Heroku backup skip** — `BackupManager` now detects Heroku (`DYNO` env var) and skips `pg_dump` for managed Postgres, recommending `heroku pg:backups` instead
- **Noisy orchestrator context messages** — Replaced verbose SSE "thinking" events for context usage with quieter log-level messages to reduce UI clutter
- **LLM error formatting** — Improved error message formatting in LLM error classes
- **Registration race condition** — Concurrent duplicate email registrations now caught by DB `IntegrityError` and returned as 409 instead of 500
- **Invite accept commit on early return** — `accept_invite` now commits invite status change when user is already a project member, preventing the update from being silently rolled back
- **PATCH project response missing user_role** — `update_project` now returns a full `ProjectResponse` with `user_role` instead of the raw ORM object
- **Chat feedback learning trigger** — Negative feedback learning now triggers based on the clamped rating value instead of the raw request value, ensuring ratings like -2 or -5 still fire the learning pipeline
- **Reconnect handler connection leak** — `reconnect_connection` now always calls `connector.disconnect()` in a `finally` block, preventing connection/tunnel leaks on successful health checks
- **MCP connector TypeError on health check** — Reconnect and test-connection endpoints now gracefully handle MCP connections that don't support the `DatabaseAdapter` interface
- **Session rename title validation** — `SessionUpdate.title` now enforces `min_length=1` and `max_length=255` to prevent empty or oversized session titles
- **useRestoreState access detection** — `isAccessError` now detects permission errors by matching actual API error messages instead of just HTTP status code strings
- **Missing model imports** — Added 5 missing models (`BatchQuery`, `DataBenchmark`, `Dashboard`, `DataValidationFeedback`/`DataInvestigation`, `SessionNote`) to `models/__init__.py` for consistent mapper registration
- **Integration test auth for /health/modules** — Tests for the authenticated `GET /api/health/modules` endpoint now use `auth_client` instead of unauthenticated `client`
- **Performance smoke test limit for external API** — `test_models_list_latency` now uses a 2-second limit appropriate for the external OpenRouter API call instead of the 300ms internal-only limit
- **Mobile sidebar missing Dashboards** — Added Dashboards section to mobile sidebar drawer, matching desktop feature parity
- **DashboardBuilder JSON.parse crash** — Wrapped `visualization_json` parse in try/catch to prevent builder crash on malformed data
- **Investigation IDOR** — `get_investigation` and `confirm-fix` endpoints now verify the investigation's connection belongs to the requested project, preventing cross-project data access
- **SQL safety guard bypass** — UPDATE pattern now matches qualified table names (`schema.table`, `"schema"."table"`) and added MERGE/UPSERT DML patterns to read-only guard
- **Backend container runs as root** — Dockerfile.backend now creates a non-root `appuser` and runs the application with reduced privileges
- **Auth store localStorage consistency** — `storeAuth` now uses the safe-storage module matching the rest of the auth store, preventing partial state on Safari private mode
- **Pipeline end event not emitted** — Complex query and pipeline resume paths now emit `pipeline_end` event, preventing SSE streams from hanging indefinitely
- **SQL agent connector leak** — Connector cache now capped at 32 entries with LRU eviction and stale connector detection, preventing unbounded connection growth
- **Session title generation MissingGreenlet** — `generate_session_title` now uses explicit async query instead of triggering lazy-loaded relationship
- **Chat search LIKE injection** — Search term `%`, `_`, `\` characters now escaped before building LIKE pattern
- **WebSocket error information leak** — Error handler now sends generic message instead of raw exception string
- **SSE event regex mismatch** — Frontend SSE parser now matches hyphenated event names (e.g., `pipeline-end`)
- **ChatInput max length mismatch** — Frontend char limit raised from 4000 to 20000 to match backend
- **ChatMessage note state not reactive** — Note saved indicator now uses reactive Zustand subscription
- **Learning IDOR** — `update_learning` now verifies ownership before mutating, preventing cross-connection learning edits
- **MongoDB URI credential encoding** — Username and password now URL-encoded with `quote_plus` to handle special characters
- **SSH tunnel race condition** — Per-key asyncio locks prevent concurrent tunnel creation for the same config
- **ClickHouse password in process list** — Exec templates now pass password via environment variable instead of CLI argument
- **SSH key delete without user_id** — `delete()` now called with `user_id` for ownership verification consistency
- **Schedule pagination** — `list_schedules` and `get_history` endpoints now accept `skip`/`limit` query params
- **Alert conditions validation** — `alert_conditions` JSON validated as array with max_length; `notification_channels` capped
- **Result summary size cap** — Schedule run results truncated to 50 rows if JSON exceeds 1MB
- **Benchmark query unbounded** — `get_all_for_connection` now limited to 500 results
- **OpenRouter model fetch contention** — Double-check locking pattern reduces lock contention during cache misses
- **Connection service default limit** — `list_by_project` default reduced from 2000 to 200
- **Test connection error sanitization** — Error messages truncated to 500 chars to prevent internal detail leaks
- **Input validation hardening** — Added `max_length` to `LearningUpdate.lesson`, `SshKeyCreate.passphrase`, `mcp_env` size limits
- **Orchestrator fire-and-forget warning** — `ensure_future` callback now retrieves exceptions to suppress "Task exception was never retrieved" warnings
- **Default rules protection** — Default rules (system-generated) now return 403 on update/delete attempts, preventing accidental corruption
- **Shared notes access broken** — `get_note` and `execute_note` now use `_require_note_access` which allows project members to access shared notes (previously always returned 403)
- **NoteCard comment editing for non-owners** — Comment section now read-only for non-owners, preventing guaranteed 403 failures
- **Viz endpoint DoS** — `RenderRequest` rows capped at 10K, `ExportRequest` at 50K, columns at 500 to prevent server OOM
- **Dashboard update/delete membership check** — Both endpoints now verify project membership before checking creator ownership
- **Session notes unbounded queries** — `_find_similar` capped at 100 candidates, `get_notes_for_context` capped at 200 with 50-note default return
- **Rules rate limiting** — Added rate limits to `list_rules` (60/min) and `update_rule` (20/min)
- **Dashboard refresh parallelized** — `handleRefreshAll` now uses `Promise.allSettled` instead of sequential awaits
- **DashboardBuilder noteMap memoization** — `noteMap` wrapped in `useMemo` to prevent needless re-renders
- **Frontend input maxLength** — Added maxLength to RulesManager name/content, DashboardBuilder title inputs
- **ChartRenderer unknown type fallback** — Shows descriptive message instead of blank rectangle for unsupported chart types

### Security
- **Auth register error sanitization** — Register endpoint no longer exposes internal ValueError messages; returns static "already exists" message while logging details server-side
- **Rate limits on write endpoints** — Added rate limits to 7 previously unprotected mutation endpoints (PATCH projects, PATCH/DELETE sessions, generate-title, feedback, mark notification read, delete SSH key)
- **Probe service SQL injection hardening** — Tightened `_VALID_TABLE_RE` regex to reject quote characters; added `_quote_identifier()` with proper double-quote escaping per SQL standard
- **WebSocket input validation** — Chat WebSocket handler now validates incoming JSON with `WsChatMessage` Pydantic model (enforces message length, provider/model max_length)
- **Credentials cleanup** — Deleted local `notes.md` containing plaintext DB password and SSH private key (never committed to git history)

### Fixed
- **LLM health checks activated** — `start_health_checks()` now called on app startup; failed providers auto-marked unhealthy and skipped in fallback chain until recovered
- **Connector query result row cap** — All 4 DB connectors now cap results at 10,000 rows with `truncated` flag, preventing OOM on large result sets
- **useRestoreState race condition** — Sequence counter prevents stale restore data from overwriting user's active project selection during rapid switching
- **Misleading reconnect banner** — ChatPanel connection-down banner now says "Click Retry to reconnect" instead of the inaccurate "Attempting reconnect..."
- **Form input length limits** — Added maxLength to all text inputs in OnboardingWizard and ConnectionSelector (hosts, ports, credentials, URLs, commands)
- **Connector query timeout** — All connectors now use `settings.query_timeout_seconds` (default 30s) instead of hardcoded 120s
- **Workflow tracker synchronization** — `subscribe()` and `unsubscribe()` now async and acquire `_lock`, matching `_broadcast`'s locking discipline
- **Error boundary logging** — Both ErrorBoundary and SectionErrorBoundary now log caught errors with component stack via `componentDidCatch`
- **WebSocket token usage tracking** — WebSocket chat path now records LLM token usage via UsageService, matching HTTP `/ask` and `/ask/stream` endpoints (costs were previously untracked for WS users)
- **Toast notification cap** — Toasts limited to 5 max; oldest evicted when exceeded (prevents screen flooding during network failures)
- **Unbounded message loading** — `ChatService.get_session()` no longer eagerly loads all messages via `selectinload`; messages now fetched with DB-level LIMIT/OFFSET
- **SSH tunnel cleanup on connection delete** — `ConnectionService.delete()` now closes associated SSH tunnels across all connector types, preventing tunnel accumulation
- **localStorage Safari compatibility** — All localStorage access across 9 files wrapped in try/catch to prevent crashes in Safari private browsing mode
- **JWT expiry zombie state** — `scheduleRefresh` now triggers immediate logout with toast when token is already expired, instead of silently returning
- **WrongDataModal focus trap** — Tab key now cycles within the modal when open, preventing keyboard users from tabbing into background content
- **SSE stream deduplication** — `ConnectionHealth` components now use a shared event bus instead of each opening its own SSE stream to `/workflows/events`
- **Connector pool leak** — All 4 DB connectors (Postgres, MySQL, MongoDB, ClickHouse) now close existing pool/client in `connect()` before creating new ones, preventing connection leaks on repeated connect calls
- **Silent exceptions in sql_agent.py** — Added `logger.debug(exc_info=True)` to 13 previously silent `except` blocks in context-loading helpers, making failures diagnosable from logs
- **ConnectionHealth loading state** — Component now shows pulsing indicator during initial health check instead of immediately displaying "unknown" status
- **Accessibility** — Added `aria-label` attributes to 3 inputs in `ClarificationCard` and `MetricCatalogPanel` that only had placeholder text

### Added
- **Frontend API retry** — GET/HEAD requests automatically retry up to 2 times on network errors and 502/503/504 with exponential backoff; mutation methods (POST/PATCH/DELETE) never retry
- **TTLCache utility** — Generic TTL + LRU cache class (`app/core/ttl_cache.py`) with bounded size and time-based expiry
- **Safe storage utility** — `safe-storage.ts` module with try/catch-wrapped localStorage helpers
- **SSE event bus** — Local pub/sub (`broadcastEvent`/`onEvent`) in `sse.ts` for sharing SSE events without duplicate streams
- **Custom 404 page** — Branded `not-found.tsx` with dark theme styling and link back to home
- **Focus refresh** — `useRefreshOnFocus` hook re-fetches projects, connections, and sessions when browser tab regains focus (throttled to once per 30 seconds)

### Performance
- **Agent cache LRU eviction** — `sql_agent` and `knowledge_agent` caches now use TTLCache with max_size=128, preventing unbounded memory growth over long runtimes
- **Lazy-loaded react-markdown** — `ChatMessage.tsx` and `SQLExplainer.tsx` now use `next/dynamic` to load `react-markdown` on demand as a separate chunk

### Changed
- CI coverage threshold raised from 69% to 72%
- **Chat feedback redesign** — Removed quick-action chips, FollowupChips, DataValidationCard, and WrongDataModal from chat messages. Thumbs up/down now record data validation and thumbs down auto-triggers agent investigation in chat
- **Sidebar "+New" redesign** — Moved all "+New" buttons from section content into section header "+" icons that appear only when expanded. Applies to Projects, Connections, Chat History, Rules, Schedules, and Dashboards

### Security
- **KnowledgeAgent cache isolation** — Fixed critical cross-project data leakage where cached knowledge could bleed between projects (single-slot cache → dict keyed by project_id)
- **MCP connection IDOR** — Added project ownership check before using MCP connections in orchestrator
- **SafetyGuard on diagnostic queries** — Investigation agent `run_diagnostic_query` now validates SQL through SafetyGuard before execution
- **SafetyGuard on schedule run-now** — Manual schedule execution now applies the same safety checks as the cron scheduler
- **Rate limiting** — Added rate limits to `/visualizations/render`, `/exploration`, `/semantic-layer`, `/reconciliation`, `/temporal` endpoints

### Fixed
- **Build type error** — Fixed TypeScript build failure in ChatSessionList.tsx: added proper type assertions for metadata fields after Record<string, unknown> migration
- **Health modules auth** — /api/health/modules now requires authentication, preventing unauthenticated infrastructure reconnaissance
- **Session messages pagination** — GET /sessions/{id}/messages now supports limit/offset (default 500, max 2000) to prevent unbounded responses
- **Knowledge cache TTL** — KnowledgeAgent and SQLAgent now expire cached project knowledge after 5 minutes, preventing stale data after DB/schema updates
- **Query timeouts** — MySQL and ClickHouse connectors now enforce 120s query timeout via asyncio.wait_for, preventing pool exhaustion from long-running queries
- **Connector disconnect safety** — All 6 connectors (postgres, mysql, mongodb, clickhouse, mcp, ssh_exec) now use try/finally in disconnect() to always clear handles even when teardown throws
- **Keyboard shortcut conflict** — Removed duplicate Cmd/Ctrl+K handler from ChatInput; ChatSearch now exclusively owns the shortcut
- **Double-submit guards** — ConnectionSelector handleUpdate/handleIndexDb/handleSync and ScheduleManager toggle now prevent duplicate API calls on rapid clicks
- **useRestoreState race** — Added cancellation flag to prevent stale async restore results from overwriting store after unmount or auth change
- **ProjectSelector race** — Added sequence counter to discard out-of-order API responses when rapidly switching projects
- **Health endpoint** — /api/health now verifies DB connectivity (SELECT 1), returns 503 when database is unreachable
- **Graceful shutdown** — Indexing and sync background tasks are now cancelled during app shutdown
- **seedActiveTasks race** — useGlobalEvents checks active flag before writing to store, preventing stale seed after disconnect
- **Markdown image blocking** — ChatMessage and SQLExplainer now block markdown img tags to prevent arbitrary external image requests
- **Suggestion stale closure** — ChatPanel suggestion reset now depends on activeProject?.id, ensuring suggestions reload on project switch
- **ConnectionHealth feedback** — Reconnect failure now shows error toast instead of silently swallowing errors
- **Silent exceptions** — Added debug logging to remaining silent except blocks (WebSocket send, OpenRouter error body, tunnel introspection)
- **Input validation** — Added max_length constraints to ConnectionCreate (10+ fields) and ProjectUpdate (10 fields)
- **localStorage quota safety** — Wrapped localStorage.setItem calls in auth-store and app-store with try/catch to handle QuotaExceededError gracefully
- Recreated backend venv to fix stale shebangs from old project path
- **InsightFeedPanel** now shows "Couldn't load insights" with Retry when API fails (previously showed misleading empty state)
- **DashboardList** now shows "Couldn't load dashboards" with Retry when API fails (previously showed misleading empty state)
- **ConnectionSelector** now shows "No connections yet" empty state when no connections exist
- **VizRenderer** now shows "Visualization data unavailable" instead of rendering nothing when payload is missing
- **SSE stream completion guard** — Chat stream now fires `onError` if server ends without result/error event, preventing stuck loading state
- **DataValidationCard** — Removed premature optimistic `setVerdict` before API confirmation; UI only updates on success
- **AccountMenu** — Added Escape key handler for keyboard dismissal
- **RetryStrategy** — Fixed empty repair hints when COLUMN_NOT_FOUND has no suggested columns
- **Sidebar callbacks** — Replaced 11 inline lambdas with stable useCallback refs to prevent unnecessary child effect re-runs
- **Notes store** — `loadNotes` failure now shows toast error instead of silent empty state
- **Silent exceptions** — Added debug logging to 10+ previously silent `except: pass` blocks across chat, connectors, and agent modules
- **Accessibility** — Added dialog semantics to BatchRunner, aria-labels to icon-only buttons and form inputs across 6 components
- **Performance** — Narrowed Zustand selectors in 17+ components to prevent full-store re-renders
- **test_alembic.py** — use `sys.executable -m alembic` instead of bare `alembic` CLI to avoid picking up system Python outside venv
